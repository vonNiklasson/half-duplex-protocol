# half-duplex-protocol
A digital communication protocol, using a one output for sending data, and an input for receiving data.

More info coming soon.

## Bitrate/Frequency
At the current state the protocol peaks at around 50hz. Any more than that and the program will have a hard time catching up on the bits sending. An extra wire for pulse setting could solve that issue.
